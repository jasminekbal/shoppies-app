# Welcome to The Shoppies App

This project was created for a developer challenge for one of my dream companies.

## What it does

This is a simple webpage that allows users to browse movies and nominate their favourites for a Shopify Movie Award

## Something to consider

I am an aspiring Front-End developer that wants to grow into a well rounded T-Shaped software engineer and for that I've been dabbling in design as well. So, I designed this webpage on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/L1Q8Q3hJRIDuQRJDZvPuvn/Shopify?node-id=0%3A1) prior to coding it.
